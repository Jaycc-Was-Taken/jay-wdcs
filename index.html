            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>I am Jay and I am currently taking the <em>Full-Stack Engineer</em> career path on <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></p>
            <p>I am a big fan of being able to fully use a website when you have two different windows right next to each other on one monitor. So this website is primarily designed with that in mind, so that I am able to code and reference the site easily on one 1080p monitor, with VSC being larger than the website.</p>
            <p>A lot of this site will feature design elements that were a lot more common in earlier days of the internet and early web2.0, but I really like them.</p>
